# ARMACOM
ARMACOM provides a framework for ARMA to communicate with Arduinos and any other device that can connect to or emulate a Windows COM port.

The extension that powers ARMACOM and the additional functions it provides are covered in a seperate GitHub here: https://github.com/googleben/ArmaCOM
